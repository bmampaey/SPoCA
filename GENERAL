General considerations of the implementation of SPoCA.
<BR>@subpage preprocessing
<BR>@subpage ALC

SPoCA is implemented as a series of steps, that are all present in the @ref classificaton.x program.

These are:
 - @ref preprocessing of the EUV images
 - Classification of the pixels of the images using a Classifier
 - Optionally , adjustement of the centers found by the classification, followed by an attribution to apply that adjustement.
 - Segmentation of the pixels of the image into classes.
 - Extraction of the Active Regions and or Coronal Holes from the segmented map.
 - Computation of various statistics on the extracted regions.


@page preprocessing Preprocessing
The preprocessing of the sun images is a series of transformation of the image that are executed one after the other, in the order they are given.
The currently defined transformation are:
@param NAR Nullify Above Radius. Put null values in the pixels above a percentage (radiusratio) of the radius.
@param ALC Apply Annulus Limb Correction. See @ref ALC
@param DivMedian Division of the intensities by the median intensity
@param TakeSqrt Take the square root
@param TakeLog Take the log
@param DivMode Division of the intensities by the mode
@param DivExpTime Division by the Exposure Time

@page ALC Annulus Limb Correction
The Annulus Limb Correction is a method to correct the limb brightness on EUV Sun Images. It has been described in 

It has received several improvements by Cis Verbeeck and Benjamin Mampaey.

The currently implemented solution is to modulate the effect of the ALC with a function going from 0 to 1 along an ascending sine, staying at 1, and then finaly decreasing to 0 along a descending sine.

This functions has 4 parameters, the first value where it starts increasing from 0, the second value where it reaches it's maximal of 1, the third value when it starts decreasing again and finally the fourth value where it reaches 0 again.

These 4 parameters are givens as percentages of the radius of the sun. For example 80,100,110,120 means that annulus limb correction will start at 80% of the sun radius. Increase along a sine until it's maximum at 100% of the sun radius (== the sun radius), starts decreasing along a sine from 110% of the sun radius, and will stop at 120% of the radius.
