@section building_seq Building the software

The programs have been develloped to run on linux and have not been tested on any other plateform.

To compile a program named program_name.x type "make -f program_name.mk -B", this will generate the corresponding executable in the bin directory.

If there is no make file for a program you can always try to generate one with the command ./script/makemake.pl ./programs/program_name.cpp.
It should generate a file ./program_name.mk

You can always get help for a program or a script by calling it with the -h option 
 
@section organistaion_sec Organisation of the software directory tree

The directories are organized as follow :

- spoca			: repository for the makefiles
- spoca/programs	: repository for the main c++ files of programs
- spoca/classes		: repository for the classes .h and .cpp files (classifiers, images, ...) written specifically for SPoCA
- spoca/bin		: repository for executables
- spoca/objects		: repository for temporary object files during compilation
- spoca/cgt		: a library of graph class
- spoca/script		: repository of scripts (mainly in perl) to help in running spoca and manipulating output (creation of movies, ...)

You can regenerate it by changing to the spoca directory and running doxygen like so "doxygen documentation/Doxyfile.cfg"
