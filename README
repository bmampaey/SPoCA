General consideration:
To make a program named program_name.x type "make -f program_name.mk -B", this will generate the corresponding executable in the bin directory.
If there is no make file for a program you can always try to generate one with the command ./script/makemake.pl ./programs/program_name.cpp. It should generate a file ./program_name.mk
You can always get help for a program by calling it with the -h option 

The directories are organized as follow :
spoca		: repository for the makefiles
spoca/programs	: repository for the main c++ files of programs
spoca/classes	: repository for the classes .h and .cpp files (classifiers, images, ...) written specifically for SPoCA
spoca/bin		: repository for executables
spoca/objects	: repository for temporary object files during compilation
spoca/cgt		: a library of graph class
spoca/script	: repository of scripts (mainly in perl) to help in running spoca and manipulating output (creation of movies, ...)
spoca/utilities: repository for some utilities program

There are also 1 directory for your convenience :
spoca/results
